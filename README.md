# Baby names with A

There is this weird tradition in my family where all the names start with **A**, so I decided to make this little filter/website that generates randomly names that start with **A**.

(yes, I was bored)

### Filter

The filter is made in Python with [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org) to parse the CSV files and create the JSON.

The names were extracted from [this repo](https://github.com/jvalhondo/spanish-names-surnames), all credits to [jvalhondo](https://github.com/jvalhondo).

### Website

The website is hosted in Glitch and uses a fetch to get the data, nothing surprising :P


### Dedication

I made this little project just to see my girlfriend smile, Mariana if you read this, I love you <3
